### About the code

Stop spending six months digesting Apple iOS developer docs, or three months on a Standford course.  

As a pro JavaScript developer, start writing app-store ready iOS apps *this afternoon* with React Native!

Learn how:

[React Native: Into a new world of rapid iOS development](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mobile/library/mo-bluemix-react-native-ios8/index.html)

Or if you're new to React altogether, read this for background:

[React: Create maintainable, high-performance UI components](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-react-intro/index.html)

You'll be creating a complete viewer app that let you select a video:

And play it:

It also displays a list of customizable articles:

And allow you to read your selection.

Plus you'll learn what's ticking inside React Native.
